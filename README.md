# Mini-Chatbot

### DESCRIPTION

The program is a simple chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate conversational responses based on user input. It allows users to have an interactive conversation with the chatbot by exchanging messages. The chatbot responds to each user input by generating a text response using the powerful language generation capabilities of GPT-3.5. Additionally, the program performs sentiment analysis on the generated responses to determine their positive or negative sentiment. Users can continue the conversation until they decide to exit. The chatbot offers a basic chat experience and can be further enhanced with additional functionality for improved interaction and context awareness.
